<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The wind is commonly known for being cool, but Jett is an aggressive agent who has a distinctive, sarcastic personality.<br> Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount of arrogance. Her self-confidence may feel as if she is disregarding her comrades' safety, but she has recognized that it is best to play with a team, albeit with some reluctance. She does show a much more friendly personality towards teammates.<br> Her youth is apparent as she animatedly chats with her allies, and she can sometimes spitball whenever she's excited to share ideas.
